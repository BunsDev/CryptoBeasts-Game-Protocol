# CryptoBeasts

CryptoBeasts is a PvP card game where you defy your friends or play against strangers just to have fun, you are not becoming rich by playing it.

This repository contains the smart contracts for the token (the coin), the game (the cards) and the marketplace (the shop).

It uses the [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/) framework for the smart contracts.

It also uses [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for testing and deployment.

This is a work in progress by LAML, MAPV and GMVS. We are a group of grad students from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
